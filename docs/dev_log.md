Checked in with Hamish regarding the progress of the application. Everything outside of the application is running smoothly - documentation is mostly completed, flowchart has been completed and the implementation plan is being followed and updated.
Within the application, I have run into a significant roadblock regarding the reading and writing of JSON files - I have spent a full day attempting to work out the issue, however, I repeatedly receive the same error when attempting to parse the JSON file to be read in the app.
Will be spending some time with Hamish this afternoon attempting to work out where my code has slipped up. Until then, I have been focussing on cleaning up the apps appearance and finishing the other minor features.
