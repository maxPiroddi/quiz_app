Checked in with Hamish regarding the progress of the application. Everything outside of the application is running smoothly - documentation is mostly completed, flowchart has been completed and the implementation plan is being followed and updated.
Within the application, I have run into a significant roadblock regarding the reading and writing of JSON files - I have spent a full day attempting to work out the issue, however, I repeatedly receive the same error when attempting to parse the JSON file to be read in the app.
Will be spending some time with Hamish this afternoon attempting to work out where my code has slipped up. Until then, I have been focussing on cleaning up the apps appearance and finishing the other minor features.

Check in with Garret regarding my progress with the application. Informed him that after my session with Hamish yesterday, I was able to understand and implement the usage of JSON files, allowing me to complete my application. Implemented features last night, and spent the morning today cleaning up the code and doing preliminary error handling/checking. The rest of today will be spent finalising my documentation and error checking. I have completed the required terminal arguments within my application, as well as creating the required executable to move files to a new directory. The project should be finished by this evening, allowing me to spend tomorrow double checking all errors and cleaning up the user-interface of the application. I feel confident that I will be happy with everything completed on time.
